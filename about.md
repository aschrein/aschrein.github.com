Worked at Intel on CPU/GPU compilers, GPU driver, tools and source to source translation. Before that worked at various small companies doing weird staff.  
Finished bachelor of physics at Novosibirsk State University at 2012.  
My learning curve started ~10 years ago, my first programming project was naive N-body simulation in Pascal.
